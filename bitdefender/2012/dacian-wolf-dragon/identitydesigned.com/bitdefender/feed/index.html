					<description><![CDATA[@Michael, thank you.

@Paul, two years of development can wear out many people, so—careful what you&#039;re wishing for. :)

Regarding the &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;defender&quot; fusion in the wordmark, there are a few reasons for that — I&#039;ll mention two here: firstly, both &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;defender&quot; are common (dictionary) name parts, thus hard to &quot;own&quot; and… defend. Secondly, we found &quot;bit&quot; in certain key markets having undesired connotations. A complete name change was impossible, so we opted to forge the two words into a single proper noun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Obviously a lot of thought, care and work went into this. I wish some of our clients allowed 2 years for an identity change... The dragon-wolf symbol is quite an effective manifestation of the brand (though I find the line art versions so minimal as to be a pure abstraction).

I wonder why some kind of distinction between the words &#039;bit&#039; and &#039;defender&#039; was removed, though? While the previous wordmark was ripe for a change, the fact that the word &#039;defender&#039; was differentiated really helped make the name more powerful. To me, turning the word mark into a single word makes it hard to read (at least for English speakers) and reduces its impact.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome redesign. I absolutely love the new logo, especially because it has a strong background story which now merges with the new. It&#039;s amazing how the flowing lines of the Dragon-wolf meet the  F-117 Nighthawk&#039;s jagged lines. I like the textured belly of the 3D logo and as shown throughout the presentation, that can be used for many different things while maintaining a link with the logo. I&#039;m happy this isn&#039;t a redesign of the color scheme too, keeping the Red/Black it&#039;s like saying &quot;Yes, this is the same great product you&#039;ve been using, only better and in new clothes.&quot;

Great job guys!

Plus, I need to get myself that T-Shirt from 1:23.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very impressed by the systematic approach and great design skills that are on display here. There are two semantic aspects where I&#039;m not 100% sure that they are on the same level as the rest. The name &#039;bitdefender&#039; is a little too obvious and lacks the refinement otherwise found. The mystical rendering evokes resemblance to a snake and as such that of an intruder (rather than a defender).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome. Such a well thought out campaign and the work truly shows that. As Steve said I do like that you took the simplistic approach of the line art for the logo and kept the avatar for other applications. Everything is just drawn together so perfectly in this, from the font to the line art. Great work guys!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really, really like this. A very well thought out rational and thought process through to execution. I certainly prefer the &#039;hero&#039; brand avatar as as opposed to the line art symbol as, personally I feel it could be made a bit more wolf like, having said that the simplistic need is obvious.

Great job!]]></description>
